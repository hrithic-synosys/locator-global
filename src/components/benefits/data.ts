    title: 'Reduced operating cost',

    title: 'Compliance with programmed routes',
    desc: 'Ensure drivers do not deviate from an authorised route, and review the entire movement history whenever a journey is questioned.',

  {
    title: 'Increased productivity',
    desc: 'Track lunch and break hours, expose unauthorised stops, and evaluate overtime requests against what actually happened. Companies typically see a 25% increase in work orders completed after implementing GPS tracking.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Rewarding your dedicated workers',
    desc: 'Nothing discourages a hard-working team faster than watching slack colleagues take home the same wage. The evidence a tracking system provides lets you direct training where it is needed and reward the people carrying the work.',

  {
    title: 'Reduction and control of overtime',
    desc: 'A significant fall in overtime is among the most immediate returns on a GPS vehicle tracking system. Organisations consistently report a substantial decline in overtime claims after installation, which translates directly into higher productivity.',

    title: 'Lower maintenance spend',

    title: 'Vicinity of the fleet',

    title: 'Vehicle recovery',

    title: 'Control of personal use',
    desc: 'Many organisations permit vehicle use outside working hours so long as it stays reasonable. That policy is routinely misused, and the excess drives up leasing, fuel and maintenance costs. Tracking curbs the misuse, and the savings usually exceed the cost of the system itself.',
